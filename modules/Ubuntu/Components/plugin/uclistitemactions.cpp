 * \ingroup unstable-ubuntu-listitems
 * \brief Provides configuration for actions to be added to a ListItem.
 *
 * ListItem accepts actions that can be configured to appear when tugged to left
 * or right. The API does not limit the number of actions to be assigned for leading
 * or trailing actions, however the design constrains are allowing a maximum of
 * 1 action on leading- and a maximum of 3 actions on trailing side of the ListItem.
 *
 * The \l actions are Action instances or elements derived from Action. The default
 * visualization of the actions can be overridden using the \l delegate property,
 * and the default implementation uses the \c name property of the Action.
 *
 * The leading and trailing actions are placed on a panel item, which is created
 * the first time the actions are accessed. The colors of the panel is taken from
 * the theme's palette.
 *
 * When tugged, panels reveal the actions one by one. In case an option is revealed
 * more than 50%, the option will be snapped and revealed completely. This is also
 * valid for the case when the option is visibl eless than 50%, in which case the
 * option is hidden. Actions can be triggered by tapping.
 *
 * \section3 Notes on performance
 * When used with views, or when the amount of items of same kind to be created
 * is huge, it is recommended to use cached actions as well as cached ListItemActions
 * instances. In this way we can reduce the creation time of the items:
 * \qml
 * import QtQuick 2.2
 * import Ubuntu.Components 1.2
 *
 * MainView {
 *     width: units.gu(40)
 *     height: units.gu(71)
 *
 *     UbuntuListView {
 *         anchors.fill: parent
 *         model: 10000
 *         ListItemActions {
 *             id: commonActions
 *             actions: [
 *                 Action {
 *                     iconName: "search"
 *                 },
 *                 Action {
 *                     iconName: "edit"
 *                 },
 *                 Action {
 *                     iconName: "copy"
 *                 }
 *             ]
 *         }
 *         delegate: ListItem {
 *             trailingActions: commonActions
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
