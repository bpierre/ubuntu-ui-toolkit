    \title Resolution Independence
    \contentspage {Ubuntu User Interface Toolkit}

    The objective of resolution independence is to make it easy for graphical
    user interfaces in Ubuntu to scale to all the form factors that Ubuntu
    targets: phones, tablets, laptops and desktops.
    The approach taken combines simplicity for the designers and developers
    with visual fidelity, quality and usability.


    \part Measurement Units

    A new measurement unit is defined called the grid unit, abbreviated \b{\e gu}.
    1 grid unit translates to a given number of pixels depending on the type of
    screen that the user interface is displayed on.
    For example, on a laptop computer 1 grid unit will typically translate to 8 pixels.
    The number of pixels per grid unit is chosen in order to preserve the perceived
    visual size of UI elements and therefore depends on the density of the display
    and the distance the user is to the screen. We also ensure that 1 grid unit is
    always an integer number of pixel.

    Examples:

    \table
    \header
      \li Device
      \li Conversion
    \row
      \li Most laptops
      \li 1 gu = 8 px
    \row
      \li Retina laptops
      \li 1 gu = 16 px
    \row
      \li Phone with 4 inch screen at HD resolution (around 720x1,280 pixels)
      \li 1 gu = 18 px
    \row
      \li Tablet with 10 inch screen at HD resolution (around 720x1,280 pixels)
      \li 1 gu = 10 px
    \endtable

    The grid unit defines a visual rhythm in Ubuntu and should be used for all measurements.
    Sizes of elements, spacing, margins, etc. should all use multiples of 1 gu.

    It is available from QML as a method of the global object \b units, instance of \l Units.

    Example Usage:
    \code
    import Ubuntu.Components 0.1

    Item {
        width: units.gu(2)
        height: units.gu(5)
    }
    \endcode

    Exceptionally, in order to accommodate for the rare cases where measurements of less
    than 1 gu are needed another unit is available: the density independent pixel,
    abbreviated \b{\e dp}. 1 dp typically translates to 1 pixel on laptops and low
    density mobile phones and tablets.

    Example Usage:
    \code
    import Ubuntu.Components 0.1

    Rectangle {
        height: units.dp(1)
    }
    \endcode

    \part Bitmaps

    Vector graphics, fonts and programmatically drawn elements will usually scale well
    to the different devices. On the other hand, bitmaps will typically require a bit
    more care. We require that for each bitmap the developer provides the highest
    resolution version of it. The system will perform a high quality downscaling of the
    bitmap when needed on lower density screens.

    For example, if the destination size of the bitmap is 10 gu * 10 gu and the developer
    targets a smart phone with 4 inch HD (720x1,280px) screen (1 gu = 18 px) and a tablet
    with 10 inch HD screen (1 gu = 10 px) then he/she only needs to create a bitmap of 
    180 px * 180 px to support both devices.


    \part Fonts

    It is critical for the font sizes to be consistent across Ubuntu and to
    have a rhythm defining them.
    Instead of setting the font size in pixels or points, it is imperative to
    define the font size in terms of literals:

    \table
    \row
      \li \b x-large
    \row
      \li \b large
    \row
      \li \b medium
    \row
      \li \b small
    \row
      \li \b x-small
    \endtable

    Example Usage:
    \code
    import Ubuntu.Components 0.1

    Label {
        fontSize: "small"
    }
    \endcode

    For reference when designing, these sizes correspond to the following
    pixel measurements:

    \table
    \header
      \li Font Size
      \li Desktop
      \li Smart Phone with 4" HD screen
      \li Tablet with 10" HD screen
    \row
      \li \b{\e x-large}
      \li 34 px
      \li 76 px
      \li 42 px
    \row
      \li \b{\e large}
      \li 20 px
      \li 45 px
      \li 25 px
    \row
      \li \b{\e medium}
      \li 14 px
      \li 31 px
      \li 18 px
    \row
      \li \b{\e small}
      \li 12 px
      \li 27 px
      \li 15 px
    \row
      \li \b{\e x-small}
      \li 10 px
      \li 22 px
      \li 12 px
    \endtable
