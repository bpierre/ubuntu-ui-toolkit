UbuntuColors.qml is located in the Colors subdirectory because
QuickUtils::createQmlObject() fails if the QML file is located in a
folder that has a qmldir file with JavaScript modules.

UbuntuColors 1.1 is not in a file named UbuntuColors11.qml because
we would then need UbuntuColors.qdoc for documentation, but then qdoc
won't detect the UbuntuColors type because there is no qmldir file
and generating docs fails.
